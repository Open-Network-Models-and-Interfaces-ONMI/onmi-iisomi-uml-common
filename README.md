# UML to YANG Mapping Tool
This UML to YANG Mapping Tool is developed according to the mapping rules defined in onf2015.261_Mapping_Gdls_UML-YANG.04 by OpenNetworkFoundation(ONF) IMP group.

Running the mapping tool takes the following steps.

Step 1: The user should download Node.js source code or a pre-build installer for your platform before you run this tool. The users should also install the xmlreader (a Node Packaged Module) with the following command.

npm install xmlreader

Step 2: The given uml files should be first renamed to .xml files and then copied to the "project" folder, e.g. a.uml should be renamed to a.xml. Note that if “a.xml” depends on other files, they need to be copied to the “project” folder as well.

Step 3: The user should specify the file needed to be transferred in the following texts in main.js. The texts below refers the “CoreModel.xml” file. 

var xml = fs.readFileSync("./project/CoreModel.xml", {encoding: 'utf8'});

Step 4: The user can use the following command under this directory to run this tool. 

node main.js

Step 5: After running the tool, the .yang files will be generated by the mapping tool.
