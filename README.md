# EAGLE
Project **EAGLE**: OpenSourceSDN Repository for the **Informal Inter-SDO Open Model Initiative (IISOMI)** and contains all the documents and code that the **ONF Information Model Project (IMP)** has open sourced.

The master branch of this repository only contains the license files. Each of the sub-project-specific branches will contain folders/files that are relevant to that sub-project. So in essence this repository has multiple master-branches, one per sub-project.

The following are the list of sub-projects and their associated branch (Note: Guidelines and documentation are contained in the corresponding branches):

   1. Server Generator for Python Tools --> *JsonCodeTools* branch
   2. Open Model Profile --> *OpenModelProfile* branch
   3. CIM Pruning & Refactoring Tools --> *UmlTools* branch
   4. Papyrus UML to Yang Gneration Tool --> *UmlYangTools* branch
   5. Yang to Swagger JSON/RestConf Generation Tool --> *YangJsonTools* branch
