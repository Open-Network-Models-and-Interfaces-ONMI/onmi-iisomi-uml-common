# YangJsonTools (Pyang plugin for Swagger)

[Pyang](https://code.google.com/p/pyang/) is an extensible YANG validator and converter written in python. 

It can be used to validate YANG modules for correctness, to transform YANG modules into other formats, and to generate code from the modules. We have written a pyang plugin to obtain the RESTCONF API from a yang model. 

The RESTCONF API of the YANG model is interpreted with [Swagger](http://swagger.io/), which is a powerful framework for API description. This framework will be used to generate a Stub server for the YANG module.

The proposed pyang plugin for Swagger is the result of [STRAUSS project](http://www.ict-strauss.eu/en/). The EAGLE project forks the proposed plugin from [STRAUSS github repository](https://github.com/ict-strauss/COP).

##Install pyang

Download pyang [here](https://code.google.com/p/pyang/wiki/Downloads?tm=2) (tested with version 1.5).
Extract the archive to a folder of you choice.
Install pyang  by running the following command inside that folder:

```
sudo python setup.py install
```

## Copy the swagger plugin to pyang's plugin directory:

```
sudo cp pyang_plugins/swagger.py /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pyang/plugins/
```

## Run pyang swagger plugin

Go to the `yang-cop` folder and run pyang:

```
pyang -f swagger -p yang/yang-cop service-call.yang -o service-call.json

      --use the option '-p' to specify the path of the yang models for import purposes.
```

## Have a look at the JSON output with the Swagger editor

[Swagger editor](http://editor.swagger.io/#/)


## To build a server stub

We will use the swagger code generator. The obtained swagger files from our pyang plugin are in swagger v2.0. To generate code from this swagger file version we will need the [development branch](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/develop_2.0) of the swagger code generator:


```
git clone https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.git
cd swagger-codegen/
git checkout -b develop_2.0 origin/develop_2.0
```


Go to the swagger-codegen main folder and compile the maven project:

```
mvn clean install
```

Run the code-generator by executing the compiled .jar file:

```
java -classpath 'target/swagger-codegen-2.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:target/lib/*' com.wordnik.swagger.codegen.Codegen -i path/to/service-call.json -l jaxrs
```

Run the generated server:

```
cd generated-code/javaJaxRS
mvn jetty:run
```

After starting the server open the following link: 
```
http://localhost:8002/restconf/config/calls
```
If everything worked, you will see this reply:
```
{"code":4,"type":"ok","message":"magic!"}
```
